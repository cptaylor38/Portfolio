# Portfolio

New portfolio, just having fun with React. 

This is built to resemble a multi-page application, but needs to be redesigned so that the back button within my page isn't the only way to access my home page.

A simpler solution would be to just build it as a single page application. Just playing around with styles and React itself and will redesign this to be more accessible in the meantime.

Should have this resolved by Monday, will just take some restructuring of existing components and layout. Also need to update previous projects for mobile responsiveness.
